The client api serve the purpose of getting the product list from the Shopping Cart API  https://github.com/netdevaustralia/ShoppingCartAPI. It also has the integration with third party api for the currency conversion.

# Configurations

All the releavant configuration like Urls and api key is located in the Configuration file of the project and should be updated in the same file if required. 

# Project structure
This is designed on components based and all the components are inside the src/components folder. The interfaces are bascially same structure as the response object from backend server. Making changes to the properties of the interfaces would require them to change on the backend api as well.
